Before you start, you'll need:
    - Ubuntu packages: libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev
    - A GPU/driver with OpenGL 3.0 support

Build the visualizer front end:

    qmake
    make -j<nprocs>

To build the valgrind tool, check out the latest valgrind baseline, install
the patches in the valgrind/ director, and then build valgrind.  Here,
<valgrind-dir> is the location of the valgrind repository.

    svn co svn://svn.valgrind.org/valgrind/trunk <valgrind-dir>
    cd valgrind
    make patch_valgrind VALGRIND_SRC=<valgrind-dir>
    cd <valgrind-dir>
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=<valgrind-install-dir>
    make -j<nprocs> install

Test the front end:

    ./memview ls

If you were unable to patch the valgrind tool but you have a valgrind
binary installed, you can try the front end (without the tool) using:

    ./memview --tool=lackey ls

Lackey is orders of magnitude slower than the memview tool, and doesn't
support stack traces and allocation tracking - but you can get an idea of
how the memory trace visualization works.
